    "Using the data [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC393ParlettPelleriti/main/Data/hw1.csv), build a series of SVM models as described. Make sure that data is **z score appropriately** before fitting your models. Due to the number of models you're fitting with GridSearch, this make take a while to run.\n",

    "- A. 💻 Load your data and do a 80/20 Train Test Split\n",
    "- B. 💻 Use sklearn to build an SVM model. Use `GridSearchCV` to choose the `kernel` (choose from `linear` and `rbf`), `C` (choose from `[0.001, 0.01, 1, 5, 25, 50]`), and `gamma` (choose from `[0.001,0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1,2,5]`). Print out the train and test accuracies and ROC/AUCs, and plot the train and test confusion matrices. \n",
    "- C. ✍️ What hyperparameters did GridSearch choose? (in a TEXT CELL)\n",
    "- D. 💻 Use sklearn to build a Logistic Regression on the same data with the same train/test set. Print out the train and test accuracies and ROC/AUCs, and plot the train and test confusion matrices. ([CPSC 392 code](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/blob/master/Lectures/LectureNotebooks/Logistic_Regression_II--Class9.ipynb))\n",
    "- E. 💻 Use sklearn to build a KNearest Neighbors model on the same data with the same train/test set (use GridSearch to choose `n_neighbors`).Print out the train and test accuracies and ROC/AUCs, and plot the train and test confusion matrices.   ([CPSC 392 code](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/blob/master/Lectures/LectureNotebooks/KNN--Class_14.ipynb))\n",
    "- F. ✍️ Discuss in detail how your models performed based on the metrics you printed. Write this discussion as if you are presenting your results to a CEO/Stakeholder (in a TEXT CELL)\n",
    "- G. ✍️ Compare the performance of your SVM model to the Logistic Regression and KNN model, and provide a justification for which model you want to use \"in production\" (in a TEXT CELL)"
